# 00_01 Extra Content 02: Using Exercise Files From the Course

In this course, you’ll work with **lesson-specific repositories** that you create yourself. The recommended workflow is to download the course exercise files once, then upload the relevant files into a new repository for each lesson.

The steps below walk you through:

1. Downloading the exercise files
2. Creating a new repository
3. Uploading the lesson files while preserving their folder structure

## Prerequisites

- You’re signed in to your GitHub account.
- You have access to the course exercise files repository.

## Step 1: Download the exercise files as a ZIP

1. Navigate to the **exercise files repository** for the course.
2. Select the **Code** button.
3. Select **Download ZIP**.
4. Save the ZIP file to a location on your computer (for example, your *Downloads* folder).
5. Once the download completes, **expand/unzip** the file so you can view the contents on your local system.

> [!TIP]
> Make a note of where the files are extracted—you’ll need to access them again when uploading lesson files.

## Step 2: Identify the lesson files you need

1. Open the extracted exercise files folder.
2. Locate the directory for the lesson you’re currently working on (for example: `01_04_ci_for_go`).
3. Review the contents of that lesson folder.

   - Lessons may include **multiple files and directories**
   - The folder structure is important and must be preserved when uploading
   - Note that files may also be "hidden" in your file browser due to starting with `.`, such as `.gitignore` files. You may need to create these files manually if they aren't

## Step 3: Create a new repository for the lesson

1. In GitHub, select **New repository**.
2. Enter a **repository name**.

   - Recommended: use the **same name as the exercise file directory** to make it easy to find later (for example: `01_04_ci_for_go`)
3. Enter a short **description** (for example: *Exercise files for lesson 01_04*).
4. Choose **Public** or **Private**, based on your preference.
5. Select **Add a README file**.
6. Select **Add .gitignore**.  Choose the language used in the lesson (for example, Java, Python, JavaScript, or Go).
7. Do **not** add a license.
8. Select **Create repository**.

## Step 4: Upload the lesson files

1. In your new repository, select **Add file**.
2. Select **Upload files**.
3. Open your system’s file browser:

   - **Finder** on macOS
   - **File Explorer** on Windows
   - **File Manager** on Linux

4. Navigate to the lesson folder you identified earlier.
5. **Ensure hidden files are visible** (files starting with a dot, such as `.gitignore`).

   - Some lessons include hidden files that are required.

6. Select **all files and folders** for the lesson.
7. Drag the selected files and folders **into the browser window**.

>> [!TIP]
> Using **drag-and-drop** from your file browser is the best way to upload folders.
> Using the file picker to upload individual files does **not** preserve directory structure.

## Step 5: Commit the uploaded files

1. Wait while GitHub processes the files and folders.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
3. Select **Commit changes**.

## Step 6: Verify the upload

1. Review the repository contents.
2. Confirm that:

   - Files display with **file icons**
   - Directories display with **folder icons**

3. Select a folder to verify that its subfolders and files are present.

If the structure matches the original lesson folder on your system, the upload was successful.

## Summary

Repeat this process as needed for each lesson in the course by creating a new repository and uploading the corresponding exercise files.
